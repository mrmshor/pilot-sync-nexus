-- Security Enhancement: Restrict RLS policies to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive client data

-- First, drop the existing overly permissive policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Project members can view projects with role-based filtering" ON public.projects;

-- Create separate policies for sensitive vs non-sensitive data access

-- Policy 1: Allow all project members to see basic project information (non-sensitive)
CREATE POLICY "Project members can view basic project info"
ON public.projects
FOR SELECT
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.project_members
    WHERE project_id = projects.id AND user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);

-- Policy 2: Restrict sensitive fields to only owners and admins
-- We'll implement this through a row-level filtering approach

-- Update the existing policy to be more restrictive by creating a security definer function
-- that returns projects with conditional field access
